      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Since childhood, I&apos;ve been captivated by the inner workings of
        technology. Even as a youngster, I couldn&apos;t resist the urge to
        dismantle any electronics I could get my hands on, driven by an
        insatiable curiosity to understand how they worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        At just 14, I embarked on my journey into the world of programming,
        armed with my first computer and a determination to learn. With
        self-taught VB.NET skills, I began crafting rudimentary programs to
        impress my friends and better understand programming at a basic level.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 17, to channel my passion into something tangible, I enrolled in a
        Cert IV programming course at TAFE. However, life&apos;s twists and
        turns led me through various customer service roles and even an
        engineering apprenticeship before I found my true calling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, I found my footing in the IT service desk space where my
        affinity with problem-solving and software exploration evolved. It was
        here that my passion for technology truly ignited, propelling me into
        uncharted territories of coding, development and automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fuelled by a love for gaming and a desire to create, I ventured into
        crafting a custom computer desk case, inadvertently crossing paths with
        individuals who showed me that coding was more than just a career path
        but a very useful skill. What started as a hobby quickly evolved into a
        burning ambition to pursue a career in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determined to carve my path despite the absence of formal training, I
        immersed myself in self-education, devouring countless hours of YouTube
        tutorials and Udemy courses. As a result, I honed my skills by
        continuously pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, armed with a wealth of hands-on experience, self-taught
        expertise, and an unwavering passion for innovation, I stand ready to
        embrace the next chapter of my journey. Driven by curiosity and fueled
        by ambition, I am poised to make my mark in the world of technology,
        eager to turn dreams into reality.
